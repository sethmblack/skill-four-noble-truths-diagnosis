# Four Noble Truths Diagnosis

Apply the Buddha's foundational framework to diagnose any form of suffering and identify the path to its cessation. This is the core diagnostic tool of Buddhist psychology.

- Analyzing anxiety, depression, grief, anger, or any form of dukkha
- Request for Buddhist perspective on a personal struggle
- User explicitly asks to "apply the Four Noble Truths"

## The Four-Step Framework

### Step 1: Dukkha (The Truth of Suffering)

**Purpose:** Name the suffering precisely. Not the story, but the actual experience.

**Questions to investigate:**
- What is the actual felt experience? (tightness, agitation, heaviness, etc.)
- Where does it manifest in body and mind?
- Is it physical pain, emotional distress, or existential dissatisfaction?
- What is the person resisting or struggling against?

**Categories of dukkha:**
- **Dukkha-dukkha:** Direct suffering (pain, loss, illness)
- **Viparinama-dukkha:** Suffering from change (pleasant things ending)
- **Sankhara-dukkha:** Suffering from conditioned existence (subtle dissatisfaction)

**Output:** Clear, precise description of the suffering itself, separate from its story or causes.

### Step 2: Samudaya (The Truth of the Origin)

**Purpose:** Identify the craving, attachment, or aversion at the root.

**The three types of craving (tanha):**
- **Kama-tanha:** Craving for sensual pleasure (wanting pleasant experiences)
- **Bhava-tanha:** Craving for existence/becoming (wanting to be someone, achieve something)
- **Vibhava-tanha:** Craving for non-existence (wanting to escape, disappear, not feel)

**Questions to investigate:**
- What does the person want that they don't have?
- What do they have that they don't want?
- What are they clinging to? (outcome, identity, relationship, feeling)
- What story or belief maintains the suffering?
- Is there resistance to what is?

**Output:** The specific attachment or aversion fueling the suffering.

### Step 3: Nirodha (The Truth of Cessation)

**Purpose:** Describe what peace would look like - the state beyond this particular struggle.

**Key insight:** Cessation is not getting what you want, but releasing the grip of wanting.

**Questions to investigate:**
- What would it feel like to be at peace with this situation?
- If the craving ceased, what would remain?
- What is the freedom on the other side of this attachment?

**Output:** Vision of cessation - not solving the external problem, but being at peace regardless.

### Step 4: Magga (The Truth of the Path)

**Purpose:** Identify which aspects of the Noble Eightfold Path address this specific suffering.

**The Eight Factors:**

*Wisdom (Panna):*
1. **Right View** - What understanding would shift the perspective?
2. **Right Intention** - What wholesome intention can replace the craving?

*Ethical Conduct (Sila):*
3. **Right Speech** - What communication patterns contribute to or could relieve the suffering?
4. **Right Action** - What behaviors perpetuate or could end the pattern?
5. **Right Livelihood** - Is work/life structure contributing?

*Mental Discipline (Samadhi):*
6. **Right Effort** - What mental states to abandon? What to cultivate?
7. **Right Mindfulness** - What to observe? Where to place attention?
8. **Right Concentration** - What practice would develop the needed mental stability?

**Output:** Specific, practical guidance drawn from relevant path factors.

## Constraints

- Do not promise the external situation will change - cessation is internal
- Do not dismiss or minimize the suffering - acknowledge it fully
- Do not impose Buddhist terminology unless helpful - translate to accessible language
- Focus on what the person can actually do, not abstract philosophy
- Remember: diagnosis is not cure - the person must walk the path themselves

## Example

**Input:** "I'm constantly anxious about my relationship. I keep thinking my partner will leave me and I obsessively check for signs. I can't enjoy being together because I'm always worried about losing them."

**Output:**

## Four Noble Truths Diagnosis

### The Suffering (Dukkha)
The suffering here is a persistent mental agitation - the mind unable to rest, constantly scanning for threat. There is tightness, hypervigilance, and an inability to be present. Even pleasant moments with your partner are overshadowed by fear. This is the suffering of a mind caught in future-oriented anxiety, unable to access the peace of the present.

### The Origin (Samudaya)
**Type of craving:** Bhava-tanha (craving for a particular existence) combined with vibhava-tanha (craving to not experience loss)

**Core attachment:** Attachment to a particular future - one where this relationship continues. The mind has decided that your happiness depends on this outcome.

**Underlying belief:** "If I lose this person, I will be destroyed" or "I am not okay unless I have certainty about this relationship."

Notice: you are not suffering because your partner might leave. You are suffering because you are demanding certainty where none exists, and clinging to a future that is not here yet.

### The Cessation (Nirodha)
Peace would be enjoying your partner's presence without needing a guarantee. It would be acknowledging that all relationships are impermanent (as all things are), and choosing to love fully anyway. Cessation is being present with what is - this moment, this connection - without requiring it to last forever. The relationship might continue or might not; your peace does not depend on either outcome.

### The Path (Magga)
**Relevant path factors:**

- **Right View:** See clearly that the anxiety comes from craving certainty, not from the relationship itself. Your partner cannot give you security; security comes from releasing the demand for it.

- **Right Intention:** Shift from the intention to control and secure to the intention to love and appreciate what is present now.

- **Right Effort:** When the obsessive checking arises, recognize it: "Anxiety has arisen. Craving for certainty has arisen." Do not act on it. Let it be present without feeding it.

- **Right Mindfulness:** When with your partner, practice returning to present-moment sensation. The warmth of their hand. Their voice. This breath. When the mind projects into future loss, notice: "future thinking" and return to now.

**Immediate practice:**
Each time you notice yourself checking for signs or scanning for threat, pause. Take three breaths. Ask: "What is actually happening right now?" Not in the imagined future - right now. Let the answer be simple: "We are together. This is enough."
